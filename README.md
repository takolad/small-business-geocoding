-User Story-

As a user, I want to use this website as a hub for downtown small business research.

As a user, I can visually display the locations of small business in downtown San Antonio.

I can toggle active businesses, inactive business, and changed businesses depending on what data I want to view using the buttons below the interactive map.

When I click on a dot representing a business on the map, data for that business is displayed.

I can use this page to research historical and current information on small business in downtown San Antonio.

I can also use this page as a hub with the links at the bottom of the page that leads me to additional information for research purposes.

-About This Web Application-

This page shows an interactive map of San Antonio Texas. The red bold outline specifically shows zip code 78205, which contains the downtown area including the Alamo. Our map displays five active businesses, one inactive business, and one changed business showing the geocode of each.

We have three buttons that when clicked will show the precise area of each business. By clicking the active button the map will populate our active businesses which include a popup with the business name and address on its map location. Clicking the active button a second time will clear the active businesses from the map.

This will repeat for the inactive business button as well as the changed business button. The changed business button has the name, address, and geocode location for a business that is still active but has changed location and/or name from its previous one.

Folowing the interactive map we have two cards with information on the background of downtown San Antonio historically and the nature of businesses today. Research was done in order to compose the content contained in these cards, and the text inside of this content contain the links to these web pages that were used for research. Finally at the bottom of the page, more links are provided for further research into downtown San Antonio small businesses and downtown San Antonio businesses in general.

A link to a "User Guide" is provided at the top of the page, to assist the user in navigating the website and understanding the information that it displays
